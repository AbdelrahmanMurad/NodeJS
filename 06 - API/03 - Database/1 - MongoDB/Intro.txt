- You can use MongoDB as an application, and as a server.

Data Lecture: https://youtu.be/F7RzqosS208?list=PLE5Mq0Nw_Flr1kMDtWmQYmAfURQpH3r8H

When you connect to the database, you connect to one collection not all.

The Idea of application:
    - Group of Books.
    - Each Book has Reviews.
    - Each Review has Reviewer.

- There is an id for every data, Why?? To make it unique. (auto generated) (id in MongoDB has unique dataType => objectId)

- Developer Standards: عادات برمجية
    - _id: what does mean the underscore (_)??
        - معناها انو انا بعطي معلومة للمبرمج اللي بعدي انو ما تقرب عليه
        - سيبو زي ما هو
        - Thats what the underscore means.

What is differences between the (_id) & (_book_id)??
        - in SQL, _id is a public key, and the _book_id is a foreign key.
        - in NoSQL, there is no relations, so i cant use this feature.
