- what is dotenv used for??
    - its used for Environment variables.
    - a dotenv is used to store “environment variables” AKA(Also Known As) variables we need to configure our code
        environment. This can include information like is our project running in “production” mode
        or “developer” mode but most importantly, API and database keys.
    - These are local variables that are made available to an application. Creating these variables is made easy
        with a tool like dotenv. This module loads environment variables from a.env file that you create and adds
        them to the process.env object that is made available to the application.
    - Dotenv is a simple way to allow you to create secret keys that your application needs to function and keep them from going public.


- npm i dotenv
  - in the parent folder of the project, make a file named .env => add something you dont want to push it on public (github). (like: secret key)
  - key= value
  - Uppercase is better to use.
  - No spaces
  - Single Line
  - .env needs to be globaly. How??
    - in the main file (index.js in our project)
        - require('dotenv').config()
