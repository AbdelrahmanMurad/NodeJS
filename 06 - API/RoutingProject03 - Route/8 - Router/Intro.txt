Router: https://youtu.be/JBrCwj9h4Js?list=PLE5Mq0Nw_Flr1kMDtWmQYmAfURQpH3r8H

- In Express, a Router is a way to organize your application such that your primary app.js file does not
 become bloated and difficult to reason about. Routers are like mini versions of Express applications. 
 They provide functionality for handling route matching, requests, and sending responses, but they do not start 
 a separate server or listen on their own ports.
 Routers use all the .get(), .put(), .post(), and .delete() routes that you are now familiar with. 
 You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, 
 app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post() to handle POST requests.
 The express.Router() function is used to create a new router object.
 It is used to manage incoming requests and routes them to the correct handler/code.
