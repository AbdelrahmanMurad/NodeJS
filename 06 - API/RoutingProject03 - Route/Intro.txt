Routing: https://youtu.be/5sikvmzjBdU?list=PLE5Mq0Nw_Flr1kMDtWmQYmAfURQpH3r8H


Routing for creating a link to data.
Two ways:
    - File Path.
        - if local => http://localhost/studentPortal/student/grades.php (auto)

    - Routing. (in node.js) (The Most used)
        - if local => http://127.0.0.1/studentPortal/student/grades.php (auto)
        - if global => http://iug.com/studentPortal/student/grades.php 
            - Initialize the link.
            - here the link is named route.
            - every data & resource needs route(link).
