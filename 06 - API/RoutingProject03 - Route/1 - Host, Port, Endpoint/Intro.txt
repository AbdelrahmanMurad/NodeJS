Routing - Host, Port, Endpoint: https://youtu.be/3hJeiUcttyY?list=PLE5Mq0Nw_Flr1kMDtWmQYmAfURQpH3r8H


What is Port??
 - In computer networking, a port or port number is a number assigned to uniquely identify
   a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service.

 - A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message
   is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server. It completes the destination or origination address
   of a message. A port number is always associated with a network address of a host,
   such as an IP address, and the type of transport protocol used for communication.

In some website, a port number is hidden, why??
 - If the website is using apache server, so the port number is 80, and this port is hidden.
 - There is a another way to hide it.
