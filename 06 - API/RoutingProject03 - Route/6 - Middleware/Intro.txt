- **Middleware** in **Express.js** is a function that is executed between the incoming request and the outgoing response.
 It can be used to modify the request and response objects, perform tasks such as authentication and validation,
 and even terminate the request-response cycle. Middleware functions are functions that have access to 
 the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the 
 application’s request-response cycle. They are arranged in a chain and are called in sequence. 
 Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route (or path) it’s attached to. 
 In fact, Express itself is compromised wholly of middleware functions.

- Notes:
  - Its a Component.
  - When the Request reach the server, The Route will rout(pickup) the Request. 
    And the callback of the route will return the Response.
  - Route is a layer. Middleware is also a layer, but you need to use it before Route.
  - Middleware receives all the requests.
    - So, its better for the requests go to middlewares before routes.
  - Middleware deliver request to route.
  - Middleware contains Preprocessing or Preconditioning Operations.
    - Preconditioning:  شرط مسبق لازم ينفحص قبل ما يعمل اي عملية
        - Example: lang is ar||en. 
            - لو اللغة مبعوتة وبتساوي عربي او انجلش حقق العملية
            - لو اللغة سواء كانت مبعوتة او مش مبعوتة واللغة مش عربي ولا انجلش لا تحقق العملية
            - وهذا هو الفحص قبل العملية
            - "parametersمبعوتة في ال"
        - Example: authentication & validation.
  - Middleware comes Before Route.
  - Middleware comes Before Route.
  - Middleware comes Before Route.
  - Middleware comes Before Route.
  - Middleware comes Before Route. => app.use() comes before app.get(). || app.post(). || ...etc.
  - You can make more than one middleware.
  - الترتيب مهم جدا جدا جدا جدا جدا جدا جدا
  - In Route we dont use next().
  - In Middleware we need to use next(). (اجباري)
